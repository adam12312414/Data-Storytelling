**Module:** SD2_P02 – Data Visualization and Storytelling using Tableau  

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This Tableau dashboard analyzes **OCBC Bank’s branch and agent performance** across Singapore to uncover factors influencing customer satisfaction.  
Using both **walk-in** and **call-log** datasets, the dashboard identifies underperforming branches, long waiting times, and customer pain points — presenting clear, data-driven recommendations for service improvement.

The project demonstrates storytelling in data visualization, answering the key question:  
> “How can OCBC improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency across its branches?”

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify branches with **low customer satisfaction**.  
- Determine the effect of **waiting and visit durations** on ratings.  
- Evaluate **agent performance** across channels.  
- Recommend ways to enhance **customer experience and service delivery**.  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

### 🗺️ 1. Branch Satisfaction Map  
Visualizes average satisfaction ratings across Singapore branches.  
- **Green**: High satisfaction (≥4.0)  
- **Red**: Low satisfaction (≤2.0)  
> Branches **B014**, **B001**, and **B010** show low satisfaction below 2.0 and require attention.  
> **B012** maintains the highest satisfaction (4.402) and walk-in volume (12,481), making it a role model for other branches.

---

### ⏱️ 2. Waiting Time Impact  
Shows how longer waiting times lower satisfaction.  
- Each **2-minute increase** in waiting time causes an average **1-point drop** in satisfaction.  
- Over **100,000 customers** waited beyond 6 minutes, lowering ratings to around 2.0.  
> Reducing wait times below 4 minutes significantly improves customer satisfaction.

---

### 📉 3. Patience Threshold  
Illustrates a **sharp drop** in satisfaction after 24 minutes of waiting — from 3.39 to 2.52.  
> This threshold signals when customers’ patience typically runs out.

---

### 👥 4. Agent Performance (Walk-In & Call Log)  
Treemaps highlight satisfaction across individual agents.  
- Most agents maintain scores ≥4.0 (good performance).  
- A few agents fall below 3.5 and require additional training.  
> Walk-in agents generally achieve higher satisfaction than call agents.

---

### ⌛ 5. Visit Duration vs. Satisfaction  
Analyzes if longer visit durations affect satisfaction.  
> Satisfaction remains consistent up to 10 minutes, but drops to 3.46 beyond that — showing that long visits can reduce satisfaction slightly.

---

### 🧮 6. Customer Traffic & Satisfaction  
Compares customer walk-in counts with satisfaction ratings.  
> **B012** handles high traffic (12,481 visitors) while maintaining high satisfaction, demonstrating **effective service management**.

---

### ☎️ 7. Monthly Call Volume Trend (2021–2022)  
Line chart tracking call activity trends.  
> OCBC should consider **adding staff or extending service hours** during peak months (e.g., mid-2021) to manage higher demand.

---

### 🧾 8. Recommendations & Conclusion  
#### 🔹 Key Findings  
- Long waiting times are the main cause of low satisfaction.  
- Agent performance directly influences customer experience.  
- Branch **B012** consistently outperforms others.  

#### 🔹 Recommendations  
**For Call Log Service:**  
- Train call agents to improve client interaction quality.  
- Add **self-service web options** to reduce agent workload.  

**For Walk-In Service:**  
- Use **B012** as a benchmark branch for best practices.  
- Implement a **digital queuing system** to manage waiting times.
